# SUTD-Term-4-2D

## Part 1: 32-bit adder optimization

optimized1.jsim contains the optimized 32-bit adder. It is optimized via:
  * Carry-select and carry-lookahead adder architecture
  * Using inverting logic to increase speed
  * Use buffers to reduce load-dependent delays
  * Minimize delays along critical paths

Timing:**2.23ns**

## Part 2: Translating netlist to CNF

This is the general flow: 
1. Write a python script to generate boolean expression in BC file format  
   *$ python optimized1_bcgen.py*  
2. Convert the BC file into CNF file using bc2cnf in BCpackage-0.40  
   *$ ./BCpackage-0.40/bc2cnf ./optimized1.bc ./optimized1.cnf*  
3. Run findsolssat to solve for unsatisfiability  
   *$ java -jar ./findsolssat/findsolssat.jar ./optimized1.cnf*
